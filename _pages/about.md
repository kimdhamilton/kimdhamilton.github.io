Throughout my career, I've focused on scaleable system design, algorithms, and core library/API design and implementation. 

In more recent years, I've specialized in decentralized credentialing + identity solutions and blockchain-based architectures -- including clarifying when the former and latter should meet.

### Current Role
- Director Identity and Standards, Centre Consortium


### Recent Activities
- Architect [Digital Credentials Consortium](https://digitalcredentials.mit.edu/) at [MIT Open Learning](https://openlearning.mit.edu/)
	- DCC is a multi-university, international effort designing the future of academic credentials. 
	- Our goal is to enable interoperable, standards-based credentials that put learners in control of their data.
- Co-chair [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/)
- Steering committee [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/)
- Technical Lead [T3 Innovation Network](https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/t3-innovation) Pilot Project 10, Empowering the American Student and Worker
- Guest Editor, [IEEE Dawn of the Internet Identity Layer](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/magazines/ieee-communications-standards-magazine/cfp/dawn-internet-identity-layer-and)
- Board [Rebooting Web of Trust](https://www.weboftrust.info/)

### Other Highlights

- Led design and development of the first open source [Decentralized Identifier (DID) method](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) based on the Bitcoin blockchain, called the Bitcoin Reference (BTCR) DID method. ([BTCR project page](https://www.okimsrazor.com/project/btcr-project/))
- Co-created [Blockcerts](https://www.blockcerts.org/) with the MIT Media Lab. 
	- Blockcerts is an open-source/open-standard method for anchoring Open Badges to blockchains, improving decentralization aspects of badge verification.
- Formerly CTO of Learning Machine (now Hyland), which built a credentialing product based on Blockcerts.
- Formerly a developer on the [.NET Base Class Libraries team](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/framework-libraries#base-class-libraries). 
	- Owned System.Collections, System.IO, and System.Resources namespaces, which involved creating data structures, API design, bug fixes, etc
	- Drove cross-cutting features including improving cold start performance, improving tricky interface contracts, and solutions for the MAX_PATH limitation
	- Blogged a fair bit on the [BCL team blog](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/search/en-US?rq=site%3Ablogs.msdn.microsoft.com%2Fbclteam&rn=bclteam&ral=1&query=kim%2Bhamilton&ac=4).
- Wrote [Learning UML 2.0](https://smile.amazon.com/Learning-UML-2-0-Pragmatic-Introduction-ebook/dp/B0028N4WII/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=learning+uml+2.0&qid=1614793107&sr=8-2) back in the aughts.
- B.S. in Mathematics from University of Texas at Austin and an M.S. in Applied Math from Cornell.
